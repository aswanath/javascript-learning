Price Calculator
You are calculating the final price for a product after discount and tax. The discount is applied first, and tax is calculated on the discounted price.

Write these functions:

calculateDiscount(price, discountPercent) should return the discount amount.

calculateTax(priceAfterDiscount, taxPercent) should return the tax amount.

calculateFinalPrice(price, discountPercent, taxPercent) should subtract the discount, add tax, and return the final price.

createPriceSummary(price, discountPercent, taxPercent) should return an object with price, discount, tax, and finalPrice.

Sample checks:

js

console.log(createPriceSummary(100, 20, 10));
console.log(createPriceSummary(200, 25, 5));
console.log(createPriceSummary(50, 0, 10));
Expected output:

txt

{ price: 100, discount: 20, tax: 8, finalPrice: 88 }
{ price: 200, discount: 50, tax: 7.5, finalPrice: 157.5 }
{ price: 50, discount: 0, tax: 5, finalPrice: 55 }
Do not hardcode the example values. The functions should work for other prices and percentages too.
